# Trail-Mix-Link

https://github.com/slizbethellis/trail-mix

This is a link to an app I contributed to.  I wrote the story, helped write the html/handlebars, Javascript logic, and CSS.  
I did not directly commit anything to the github because we agreed that I would send the script directly to my teammates to 
be incorporated into the final code, which is why I do not show up as a contributor.  My script was the baseline and my teamates used it as needed.

Sample app at:
